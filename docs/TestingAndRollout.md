## **1. Testing Plan**

The testing plan is divided into multiple phases: **Unit Testing**, **Integration Testing**, **Load Testing**, **Security Testing**, and **User Acceptance Testing**. Each phase focuses on ensuring different aspects of the system are working as expected before moving forward.

### **1.1 Unit Testing**

Unit testing is focused on testing individual components or functions of the system in isolation.

#### **Components to Test**:
1. **Auth-Service**:
   - Test token issuance, login functionality, and token validation.
   - Verify that registration works as expected with correct user data.
   - Ensure invalid login attempts are handled properly.

2. **File-Picker-Service**:
   - Test file uploads (local and cloud-based).
   - Verify file listing for authenticated users.
   - Test file sharing via the `POST /api/files/share` endpoint.
   - Ensure transformation requests trigger the right gRPC calls internally.

3. **File-Downloader-Service** (gRPC):
   - Simulate requests to download files from cloud providers.
   - Verify file paths and ensure files are saved correctly.

4. **File-Transformation-Service** (gRPC):
   - Ensure transformations (e.g., OCR) are processed correctly.
   - Test both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

5. **Permission-Service** (gRPC):
   - Test permission checks for various user roles (owner, shared user, no access).
   - Verify permission updates for files and folders.

6. **Notification-Service**:
   - Ensure real-time notifications via WebSocket are sent correctly for different events (file upload, transformation completion).

#### **Tools**:
- **Go Unit Testing Framework**: For unit tests of Go services.
- **Mocking Libraries**: To simulate external service calls (e.g., permission checks, file transformations).
- **Postman/Newman**: For automating REST API tests.

### **1.2 Integration Testing**

Integration testing focuses on the interaction between multiple services to ensure they work together as intended.

#### **Key Scenarios**:
1. **Auth-Service + File-Picker-Service**:
   - Test that only authenticated users can upload, list, and download files.
   - Ensure correct error responses for unauthenticated users.

2. **File-Picker-Service + File-Downloader-Service**:
   - Ensure that the file download API triggers the correct gRPC call to the **File-Downloader-Service**.
   - Verify file download from cloud storage and its availability in the system.

3. **File-Picker-Service + Permission-Service**:
   - Test file sharing (adding and revoking permissions) and access control checks.
   - Ensure users can only access files they have permission for.

4. **File-Picker-Service + File-Transformation-Service**:
   - Ensure that transformation requests result in completed tasks (OCR, image transformations, etc.) and notifications are sent.

#### **Tools**:
- **gRPCurl**: For gRPC service communication tests.
- **Postman**: For REST API integration tests.
- **Docker Compose**: To run all services together in an isolated environment and test interactions.

### **1.3 Load Testing**

Load testing ensures the system can handle concurrent requests and large-scale operations without performance degradation.

#### **Key Areas**:
1. **File Upload/Download**:
   - Stress test the system with multiple simultaneous file uploads and downloads.
   - Ensure the system handles high loads without timeouts or crashes.

2. **File Transformations**:
   - Test the system’s ability to process multiple transformation requests simultaneously.
   - Verify that asynchronous jobs do not overwhelm the system and complete within expected timeframes.

#### **Tools**:
- **Apache JMeter**: For simulating multiple user requests and testing concurrent file uploads/downloads.
- **k6**: For performance testing and benchmarking gRPC calls.

### **1.4 Security Testing**

Security testing focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring the system is protected from threats such as unauthorized access and data leaks.

#### **Key Areas**:
1. **Token Validation**:
   - Ensure that JWT tokens are correctly validated for all user-facing APIs.
   - Test token expiration and refresh mechanisms.

2. **Permissions**:
   - Verify that unauthorized users cannot access, share, or modify files they don't own.
   - Test permission escalation scenarios to ensure proper enforcement.

3. **Injection Attacks**:
   - Test the system for SQL/NoSQL injection vulnerabilities, especially in file metadata processing.

#### **Tools**:
- **OWASP ZAP**: For scanning the system for vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, etc.
- **Burp Suite**: For testing APIs against potential security threats.

### **1.5 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

UAT ensures the system meets the business and functional requirements by testing the system with real user scenarios.

#### **Key Scenarios**:
1. **User File Management**:
   - Test the user journey for uploading, listing, and sharing files.
   - Verify file download and transformation functionality from the user’s perspective.

2. **Notifications**:
   - Ensure users receive real-time notifications via WebSocket for key events like file uploads and transformations.

#### **Tools**:
- **User Feedback Sessions**: Invite a group of test users to try the system and provide feedback.

## **2. Rollout Plan**

The rollout plan is designed to ensure a smooth deployment of the file management system across environments, minimizing downtime and risk.

### **2.1 Pre-Rollout Checklist**

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Set up separate **staging** and **production** environments.
   - Ensure that databases (UserDB, FileDB, PermissionDB, NotificationDB) are properly configured and migrated with the necessary schema.

2. **Load Balancer Configuration**:
   - Set up a load balancer (e.g., NGINX or HAProxy) to distribute traffic between services and prevent overloading a single instance.

3. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Integrate logging (e.g., ELK stack - Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) and monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system health and performance in real-time.

4. **Backup and Recovery**:
   - Implement backup solutions for all databases to ensure data integrity and recovery in case of failures.

### **2.2 Rollout Stages**

#### **Stage 1: Staging Rollout**

- **Goal**: Ensure that the system works as expected in a staging environment.
- **Steps**:
  1. Deploy the services to the staging environment.
  2. Run the full **test suite** (unit, integration, load, security, UAT) against the staging environment.
  3. Fix any identified issues and re-run tests until successful.
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks for comprehensive testing.

#### **Stage 2: Production Rollout (Phased Deployment)**

- **Goal**: Roll out the system to production in phases to minimize risk.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Phase 1 (Limited Release)**: 
     - Deploy to production with limited user access (10-20% of users).
     - Closely monitor system performance and collect feedback.
  2. **Phase 2 (Full Release)**: 
     - Gradually increase the number of users until 100% rollout is achieved.
     - Monitor the system for performance bottlenecks and errors.
     - Fix any issues in real-time with hotfixes or patches.
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks for phased deployment.

## **3. Post-Rollout Improvements**

Once the system is fully rolled out, several improvements can be implemented to enhance performance, security, and scalability.

### **3.1 Rate Limiting**
- **Reason**: To prevent abuse and excessive requests from a single user or client.
- **Implementation**: Use API Gateway (Istio) or NGINX to configure rate limiting on endpoints, particularly for file uploads and downloads. Set thresholds for the number of requests per minute/hour based on service capacity.

### **3.2 Circuit Breakers**
- **Reason**: To handle potential failures in microservices, such as the **File-Downloader-Service** or **File-Transformation-Service**.
- **Implementation**: Implement circuit breaker patterns using **Istio** to prevent cascading failures when one service becomes slow or unresponsive.

### **3.3 Caching**
- **Reason**: To reduce load on the system, especially for frequently accessed data like file metadata or user permissions.
- **Implementation**: Use **Redis** or **Memcached** as a caching layer for file metadata and permission checks, reducing database access.

### **3.4 Auto-Scaling**
- **Reason**: To handle increased traffic without manual intervention.
- **Implementation**: Enable **horizontal pod auto-scaling** in Kubernetes (or AWS ECS) for critical services, scaling up or down based on CPU/memory usage or request throughput.

### **3.5 Enhanced Security**
- **Reason**: To ensure that data privacy and security remain top priorities.
- **Improvements**:
  - Implement **OAuth 2.0** for enhanced authentication.
  - Use **encryption at rest** for files stored in the system and **encryption in transit** for all communications.
